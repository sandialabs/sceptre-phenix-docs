# Apps

`phenix` apps provide a means of modifying an experiment topology, cluster
networking, hardware-in-the-loop devices, etc. in a layered, scripted, and
codified manner. `phenix` itself includes four (4) default apps that get applied
to every experiment by default. In addition to the default apps, it is possible
to apply _user apps_ to an experiment using a
[scenario](configuration.md#scenario) configuration.

## Default Apps

|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ntp     | provides/configures NTP service for experiment                                               |
| serial  | configures serial interfaces in VM images                                                    |
| startup | configures minimega startup injections based on OS type                                      |
| vrouter | customizes Vyatta/VyOS and minirouter routers, including setting interfaces, ACL rules, etc. |

### vrouter App

As of commit `e276a5b`, the `vrouter` app also supports the use of minimega's
`minirouter` to include interface configuration, DHCP and DNS configuration,
firewall rules, etc.

The following is an example of how the `vrouter` app can be configured via a
`Scenario` configuration, showing all the possible options.

!!! note
    The `ingress` and `egress` setting for ACLs are from the perspective of the
    network segment the specified interface is connected to, not from the
    perspective of the interface itself. For example, if `IF0` on a router is
    connected to VLAN `EXP_01`, then specifying `IFO: in-rules` for the
    `ingress` setting means the rules specified in the `in-rules` ruleset will
    be applied to packets "ingressing into" VLAN `EXP_01`. Under the hood, the
    rules are actually applied to packets "egressing out of" interface `IF0`.

!!! note
    Currently, the `ipsec`, `emulators`, and `snat`/`dnat` metadata sections only
    apply to Vyatta/VyOS routers.

!!! note
    Currently, the `stateful` setting for ACL rules only applies to Vyatta/VyOS
    routers.

!!! note
    Currently, the `dhcp` and `dns` metadata sections only apply to minirouter
    routers.

## Additional Core Apps

The apps listed below are provided by the core `phenix` application, but are not
considered default apps since they do not get applied to every experiment by
default. They're more like a [user app](#user-apps), but implemented in the core
application instead of as a stand-alone executable.

|     |                                                      |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------|
| scorch | [Scorch](scorch.md) &mdash; **SC**enario **ORCH**estration &mdash; is an automated scenario orchestration framework within phenix |
| soh | provide [state of health](state-of-health.md) monitoring for an experiment |
| tap | manage host taps (typically used for external network access) for an experiment |

### tap App

The `tap` app manages the creation and removal of host taps needed by
experiments to access external network resources. This includes creating the tap
in a network namespace (`netns`) to avoid interface address collisions with
other experiments, connecting the netns with the system network to enable
external network access, and modifying iptables to allow external network access
from the tapped experiment VLAN.

!!! note
    Host taps can also be used to access VM network resources directly from the
    host the VM is running on. This is an advanced topic that will be documented
    soon.

In order for a tap to have access to experiment VMs in the tapped VLAN, it must
have an IP address on the same subnet as the rest of the VMs in the VLAN.
Attempting to tap multiple experiments could fail if the VLANs being tapped are
using the same subnet, so the tap is put into a netns to provide isolation and
avoid address collisions.

With the tap in a netns, however, it no longer has a path to external networks
via the system's default netns. To remedy this, a `veth pair` is used to connect
the tap's netns with the default netns. A very small (`/30`) IP subnet is used
for the veth pair, and phenix manages the selection and tracking of the subnets
used for each pair to avoid collisions.

With the veth pair in place, packets from the experiment VLAN can now be routed
externally with the help of IP masquerading in both the tap's netns and the
default netns.

!!! warning
    This has not been fully tested against all the possible iptables firewall
    configurations. If you experience problems with external access, it may be
    due to a more restrictive iptables configuration than we've tested with.

The following is an example of how the `tap` app can be configured via a
`Scenario` configuration, showing all the possible options.

!!! note
    The `externalAccess.firewall` portion of the tap configuration has not been
    implemented yet.

```yaml title="tap app example"
spec:
  apps:
  - name: tap
    metadata:
      taps:
        # the bridge to add the tap to (will default to 'phenix' if not provided)
      - bridge: phenix
        # the experiment VLAN to tap
        vlan: MGMT
        # IP address to use for host tap -- VMs on the tapped VLAN would use this
        # address as their gateway if they need external access (and it's enabled
        # below)
        ip: 172.20.5.254/24
        # IP subnet to use for veth pair between host and tap's network
        # namespace when external access is enabled (will default to a /30
        # subnet that is not already in use by any other running experiment if
        # not provided)
        subnet: 10.213.47.8/30
        externalAccess:
          # defaults to false
          enabled: true
          # this section is planned, but not implemented yet
          firewall:
            # default action to take if none of the rules below match a packet
            default: drop
            rules:
              # action to take if a packet matches this rule
            - action: accept
              description: Only allow web access
              source:
                # can also use `addresses` to specify a list of addresses
                address: 172.20.5.0/29
              destination:
                address: 10.0.0.0/24
                # can also use `port` to specify a single port
                ports: [80, 443]
              # can also use `protocols` to specify a list of protocols
              protocol: tcp

```

## User Apps

`phenix` _user apps_ are stand-alone executables that `phenix` shells out to at
different stages of the experiment lifecycle (
`configure`, `pre-start`, `post-start`,
`running`, and `cleanup`). When `phenix` encounters an app in an experiment
scenario that isn't a default app, it checks to see if an executable exists in
its current `PATH` in the form of `phenix-app-<app name>`. If the executable
exists, `phenix` shells out to it, providing the current lifecycle stage as an
argument and providing the experiment `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` as a JSON
string over `STDIN`.

!!! note
    There will be three (3) top-level keys available in the JSON passed to a
    user app over `STDIN`: `metadata`, `spec`, and `status`. For the `configure` 
    and
    `pre-start` stages, the `status` value will be null or otherwise ignored. 
    The
    `spec` value will be [experiment schema](schema.md#experiment-schema).

!!! tip
    You can run `phenix util app-json <exp name>` to see an example of what the
    JSON that's passed to a user app looks like.

The user app can modify the experiment at will, then return the updated
JSON over `STDOUT` and exit with a `0` status. If the user app encounters an
error, it can print any error messages to `STDERR` and exit with a non-zero
status to signal to `phenix` that an error occurred.

!!! note
    `phenix` will only process updates to the `spec` value for the `configure`
    and `pre-start` stages, and will only process updates to the `status` value
    for the `post-start`, `running`, and `cleanup` stages. More specifically, it
    will only process updates to `status.apps.<app name>`, which can be anything
    the app wants it to be (e.g. a simple string, an array, or a
    map/dictionary).

!!! note
    It is possible for the execution of app stages to be canceled by the caller.
    In the case of user apps, `phenix` will send a `SIGTERM` to the user app
    process and wait a maximum of 10 seconds for the process to exit gracefully
    before killin the process with a `SIGKILL`.

for additional details.

### Example

Below is a very contrived example of a simple _user app_ that changes the disk
image used for every node in the experiment topology. Assuming the name of the
executable for this app as `phenix-app-image-changer`, it could be applied to a
topology by including a scenario in an experiment that includes an experiment
app named `image-changer`.

```python
import json, sys


def eprint(*args):
    print(*args, file=sys.stderr)


def main() :
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        eprint("must pass exactly one argument on the command line")
        sys.exit(1)


    raw = sys.stdin.read()

    if sys.argv[1] != 'pre-start':
        print(raw)
        sys.exit(0)


    exp = json.loads(raw)
    spec = exp['spec']

    for n in spec['topology']['nodes']:
        for d in n['hardware']['drives']:
            d['image'] = 'm$.qc2'


    print(json.dumps(exp))
```
